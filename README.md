You can create and save favourite places and look for rent bike points in your city. You can search for nearby things of your interest at the input box of the top in the Map view. The app can also calculate routes between your current location and a selected place from the list of favourites, so you will need to share your location if you want to do it. You can also learn where are/were exactly the seven wonders of the ancient world. For city bikes renting the app uses the information from www.citybik.es

You can watch how the app works and is used at this demo video http://bit.ly/1mkXhjq
